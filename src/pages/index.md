      My name is <mark>Tushar</mark>. I enjoy <mark>buildings things</mark> and <mark>solving problems</mark>. Problems don't exist in a vacuum and it's necessary to adapt any solution to the business or technical requirements at hand. I have worked on projects for companies <mark>from small organizations to larger companies</mark>. Expect a solution from me that makes sense for you! My <mark>mantra</mark> is to hold myself to <mark>high standards of a software professional</mark>. This means that I am committed to: write the best code I can produce in the <mark>scope of the project, accountability, responsiveness, and setting clear expectations</mark>. My (debatable) bonus perk is that <mark>I love to make spontaneous puns!</mark>
