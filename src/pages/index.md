      My name is Tushar. I enjoy buildings things and solving problems. Problems don't exist in a vacuum and it's necessary to adapt any solution to the business or technical requirements at hand. I have worked on projects for companies from small organizations to larger companies. Expect a solution from me that makes sense for you! My mantra is to hold myself to high standards of a software professional. This means that I am committed to: write the best code I can produce in the scope of the project, accountability, responsiveness, and setting clear expectations. My (debatable) bonus perk is that I love to make spontaneous puns!
