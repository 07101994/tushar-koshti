My name is **Tushar**. I enjoy **buildings things** and **solving problems**. Problems don't exist in a vacuum and it's necessary to adapt any solution to the business or technical requirements at hand. I have worked on projects for companies **from small organizations to larger companies**. Expect a solution from me that makes sense for you! My **mantra** is to hold myself to **high standards of a software professional**. This means that I am committed to: write the best code I can produce in the **scope of the project, accountability, responsiveness, and setting clear expectations**. My (debatable) bonus perk is that **I love to make spontaneous puns!**
